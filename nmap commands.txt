**Nmap Commands For Beginners**

Nmap: One of the best network mapper tool. Some people find it hard to access it. So I have decided to post "Top Most Commands of Nmap". Here we go but before let me tell you (Beginners) what can Nmap do & why as a security person you should use it?! 
1. No. of PC's & devices (their IP address) connected to your network.
2.  OS detection 
3. Search for unauthorized access to your device or network 
4. Finding out if system is infected or not
5. Finding out open ports
6. Restrict such vulnerable device from your own network

NOTE: Port scanning may be illegal in some jurisdictions so setup your own lab to test.

For those who deal with Command line scan & rest can use ZENMAP GUI.

1. Scanning a Single IP (or you can enter the host name too..)
Command:
               nmap 192.168.0.100

               nmap -v 192.168.0.100

// -v for more info

2. Scan range of IP addresses
Command:
               nmap 192.168.0.100-254

//this will scan the full range between 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.254

             nmap 192.168.0.*
//You can scan a range of IP address using a wildcard

3. Exclude Host
Command:
              nmap 192.168.0.0/24 --exclude 192.168.0.105
// (0/24 is used when you scan the network on subnet basis)

4. OS & Version Detection
